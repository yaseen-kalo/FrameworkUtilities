Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to perform file read and write operations in a Java project or utilities folder.

In this project, I showcase functionalities for handling various file formats including XLSX, Properties, JSON, and YAML. These operations allow you to read from and write to these file types, providing an effective way to manage and manipulate data in different formats within Java-based applications.
